# Walmart Sales Data Analysis Using SQL

This project is focused on analyzing Walmart sales data obtained from the Kaggle Walmart Sales Forecasting Competition. The objective is to gain insights into the performance of different branches and products, understand sales trends for various product categories, and examine customer behavior. The ultimate goal is to identify opportunities for optimizing and improving sales strategies.

The dataset comprises historical sales data from 45 Walmart stores across different regions. Each store consists of multiple departments, and participants are tasked with forecasting sales for each department within each store. Additionally, the dataset includes information about holiday markdown events, which are known to influence sales. However, predicting the impact of these markdowns on specific departments and the extent of their effects presents a significant challenge.

Through thorough analysis of the data, this project aims to address key questions such as:

Which Walmart branches are the top performers in terms of sales?
What are the best-selling products across different departments and stores?
How do sales trends vary for different product categories over time?
What factors influence customer purchasing behavior, and how can these insights be leveraged to optimize sales strategies?
How do holiday markdown events impact sales, and which departments are most affected?
By answering these questions and conducting comprehensive exploratory data analysis, this project seeks to provide actionable recommendations for enhancing Walmart's sales performance and overall business strategy.
